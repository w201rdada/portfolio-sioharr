["reviewers-like-me-1.html", "Reviewers Like Me Do I trust your opinion? How do I build trust in your opinion? How will this help Amazon?", " Reviewers Like Me Amazon, Review Relevancy, Lots of data, not much information Do I trust your opinion? Product and service reviews can sometimes be confusing. Do you have any particularly discriminating friends? When they tell you about a restaurant or a product, do you always temper their reaction – wondering if the oak overtones in their wine would actually ruin a meal? On the other hand, do you have incredibly positive people in your life who rarely complain? Are you skeptical of their “amazing, life changing” products? When heeding the advice of friends and colleagues, a potential buyer has the context to better understand the review based on the person. The buyer can then predict their own experience with the same product. However, when reading through the dozens of reviews for popular products online at a major retailer like Amazon, it is easy to get bogged down in information overload with conflicting reviews. Buying a product, sight unseen, is a risky proposition that consumers mitigate with other’s opinions, but buyers wonder who are these reviewers and how much do my needs and opinions overlap with theirs? How do I build trust in your opinion? Amazon currently provides two review options: “All reviews” and “Verified Customer Reviews”. Amazon will provide a new feature with a link called “Reviewers Like Me”. It will help potential consumers who have reviewed Amazon products in the past navigate the confusing world of online reviewers. The “Reviewers Like Me” link will be powered by a new algorithm developed at UC Berkeley’s MIDS program. Amazon will cluster customers who have submitted a significant amount of reviews based on multiple variables for the reviewer and product category. Some of the variables used in the algorithm will include: Past Orders - Regardless of the reviews posted (if any), past order history can give the algorithm valuable information about a person. For example, if a person orders many different kinds of outdoor items throughout all seasons and lives in a cold weather climate, their meaning of “warm” might be different from someone in a warmer climate. Or if they buy the same running shoe every three months, it is likely that this customer is a high mileage runner. Demographics that prove to be predictive Self reported data - customers will have the ability to answer questions that would enable better review ranking. This information is completely voluntary and will be based on the product category. Other reviewer’s deviation from the average star review as compared with the current user’s past review’s deviation from the mean Key words used in reviews Marking “helpful” for past reviews All these variables will be weighted and used in the machine algorithm for predicting similar opinions for the current user. Over time, the model will be recalibrated as the reviewer base changes. A real world example: Susie is an amazon customer who buys a significant number of products and writes frequent reviews. She is very particular about baby products and tends to review all baby items below the mean. She is also an avid reader and tends to rate classic literature higher than the average. Jane is another frequent Amazon customer and reviewer who is discriminating all around. When she considers purchasing a baby item that Susie has reviewed, Susie’s review will be included in the overall statistics from “Reviewers Like Me”, and her review will be available. However, if Jane moves onto classic literature- Susie’s review will not appear in the “Reviewers Like Me” link since their opinions do not align for this product category. Jane can always view “All Reviews” or “Amazon Verified Customer Reviews” as this will be helpful for products with sparsely reviewed products, but over time she will come to rely on the more helpful feature of “Reviewers Like Me”. How will this help Amazon? This simple solution to wading through conflicting reviews will help Amazon in several ways: 1. Consumers are more likely to buy based on trusted recommendations. This trust will continue to build over time. 2. Return shipping costs will decrease as discriminating consumers make better decisions using only similarly discriminating reviews. 3. This proposed feature will provide non-monetary incentives for consumers to review products. If providing feedback means a consumer will be rewarded with better information on their next purchase, they will be more likely to provide thoughtful, honest feedback. Their resulting reviews can in turn tell Amazon how well the algorithm is performing in a continuous feedback loop. 4. As this algorithm proves to be effective, it can be integrated with some of the product prioritization and alternate offers. This will help avoid increasingly negative reviews of products from the various clusters determined in the algorithm. "],
["aristotle-applied-1.html", "“Aristotle Applied” Keywords Giving Feedback to Teammates is Hard “Aristotle Applied” to the Rescue! Increased Self Awareness, Better Teams, Better Output", " “Aristotle Applied” Keywords Team Work Feedback Survey Giving Feedback to Teammates is Hard Employees today can expect to be a part of dozens of teams over their career. What makes a team effective? Skills? Work Ethic? Interpersonal skills? As the world becomes increasingly connected, face to face communication decreases and the ability to perceive non-verbal ques becomes more challenging. Peers are often the best sources of feedback for employees, but it is sometimes challenging to offer candid feedback to a peer that you must continue working with and may even genuinely like. For example, take Mike, a senior engineer at google. Mike was very friendly and well-liked. However, in a team setting, he took over the conversation and “everyone was scared to disagree with him.” Mike was blissfully unaware of this area for his career development until his manager asked the team to submit anonymous peer feedback. The feedback was compiled and provided to the team, and Mike had to struggle with understanding that “None of us is as smart as all of us”(Ken Blanchard) and work to address it. With coaching and additional feedback loops, Mike came to understand the importance of listening and drawing out other team members. After modifying his communication skills, Mike became a more effective employee, was happier in his job, and his team produced higher quality work. “Aristotle Applied” to the Rescue! This Big Idea proposes that the UC Berkeley Data Science program can not only transform students into data scientists, but also make them more effective team members by leveraging the “Aristotle Applied” pilot. Project Aristotle was an internal Google initiative to discover the secret sauce of consistently high performing teams. The Project Aristotle team discovered that while teams can take on many shapes and sizes and skill levels, consistently high performance teams worked well together because they encouraged everyone to take part in the coversation and understood how to read each other. With these two tendancies, individuals contribute equally in their own unique ways; thus elevating the collective intelligence of the group. The I-School already requires students to work with peers from a variety of backgrounds. These experiences can offer insights into communication styles and effectiveness if feedback from teammates is harnessed in a productive way. After every group project in every class, students will be required to submit results to an anonymous survey for each of their team members. At the mid-term and end of term, compiled, anonymous results will be shared. These surveys will not be used in the grading process, so team members can be as honest as possible. The surveys are mereley a tool to make the entire cohort more effective at working with people from a range of backgrounds. Advisors will be trained in educational support for teamwork topics and can be a resource for students who need guidance to improve. Here is the list of questions that will be included in the survey largely focused on the questions that the Google study raised as key factors for high performance teams: Project Team. Please respond on a scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). 1. Did the team have the adequate skills to complete the project? 2. Was the work evenly distributed? 3. Did all team members contribute to the discussion equally? 4. Did you personally feel safe to brainstorm ideas without judgment? 5. Did your team produce a quality product? 6. Would you want to work with this particular team again? Individual. Please respond on a scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). 1. Did John Smith contribute equally to the project? 2. Did John Smith have the skills to complete the project? 3. Did John Smith speak more (5) or less (1) than others? (Score will actually be the response’s absolute distance from 3) 4. Is John Smith a strong communicator? 5. Did John Smith encourage (5) or discourage (0) your leads? 6. Would you like to work with John Smith again? 7. Any Additional Feedback: (Free form text box) Here are some example output graphs: Trends within a Class Trends Over Program Increased Self Awareness, Better Teams, Better Output Working well in teams is a necessary skill set for any data scientist. This program gives students the opportunity to develop and refine their team skills in a safe environment. The opportunity to get valuable insights from a variety of teammates will help students become more effective at working with different types of people and more open/resilient to constructive feedback. Having a consistent set of questions to answer about teammates and to personally consider on new project endeavors will help students understand trends over time and experiment with how to produce the best results with a variety of teams. Futhermore, over time as the amount of data increaases, the full dataset could become interesting in better understanding how diverse teams thrive. These insights could be used to adjust admissions qualities or curriculum enhancements. Keeping the survey consistent over time will also let enable the school to understand if some adjustments are effective. https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html "],
